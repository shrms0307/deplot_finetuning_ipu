[Development environment]

pytorch 1.3.0
poplar SDK 3.2.0

[Help me]
When compiling graphs, low memory issues cause the kernel to die.
This is probably due to the problem of complicating the model structure when bringing the model into my development environment
Please help. Why is the model size more than 10 times larger than before?
